This command is safe to run multiple times.  In other words, the command will not fail if the specified name/version has already been cataloged.

Also note that a shipment build token is required to be specified as an environment variable using the specific naming convention below.  Shipment build tokens are generated at the environment level so you can use any environment you wish.`,
	Example: `(shipment = mss-app-web):
MSS_APP_WEB_DEV_TOKEN=xyz harbor-compose catalog
	`,
	Run:    catalog,
	PreRun: preRunHook,
