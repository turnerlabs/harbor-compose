### Harbor Compose and CI/CD

The `up` command is currently not very CI/CD friendly since it requires login credentials and uses internal-facing APIs.  That's where the `deploy` command comes in.  The `deploy` command can be used to trigger a deployment of new versions of Docker images specified in compose files (one or many shipments with one or many containers).  This works from public build services (e.g.; Circle CI, Codeship, Travis CI, etc.) by using the shipment/environment build token specified using environment variables with the naming convention, `${SHIPMENT}_${ENV}_TOKEN`.  

So, for example, to deploy an app with two shipments named, "mss-app-web" and "mss-app-worker" to your dev environment, you would add environment variables to your build.

```
MSS_APP_WEB_DEV_TOKEN=xyz
MSS_APP_WORKER_DEV_TOKEN=xyz
```

And then simply run the following to deploy all containers in all shipments specified in your compose files.

```
harbor-compose deploy
```

If you wanted to conditionally deploy to a different environment (e.g., QA) using the same set of compose files, you could...

```
MSS_APP_WEB_QA_TOKEN=xyz
MSS_APP_WORKER_QA_TOKEN=xyz
```

And then simply run

```
harbor-compose deploy -e qa
```

This allows for a clean CI/CD work flow in your build scripts...

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose push
harbor-compose deploy
```

If you're just doing CI and not CD, you can use the `catalog` command to catalog all of the built docker images but not deploy them.

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose push
harbor-compose catalog
```

#### generate --build-provider

The `generate` command has a `--build-provider` flag that can help with scenarios where teams want to take existing applications running on Harbor and migrate them to various third-party build CI/CD providers.  The idea is that a `build provider` can output the compose files along with any other necessary files required to do CI/CD using a particular provider.  The following is a list of supported providers.

`local`

Simply adds a docker-compose [build](https://github.com/turnerlabs/harbor-compose/blob/master/compose-reference.md#build) directive.


`circleciv1`

This provider will output a docker-compose.yml file with a [build](https://github.com/turnerlabs/harbor-compose/blob/master/compose-reference.md#build) directive and an image tagged with a Circle CI build number.  Note that environment variables updates in Harbor are not currently supported via the public API, and are therefore not outputted.  A `harbor-compose.yml` file and a [`circle.yml`](https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/configuration/) file are also outputted and are already setup to be able to catalog and deploy new images.  You can run this command in the root of your source code repo, and after linking your repo to Circle CI, you can commit/push the files and get basic CI/CD working.  For example:

```
$ harbor-compose generate mss-my-shipment dev --build-provider circleciv1

Be sure to supply the following environment variables in your Circle CI build:
DOCKER_USER (registry user)
DOCKER_PASS (registry password)
MSS_MY_SHIPMENT_DEV_TOKEN (Harbor shipment/environment build token)

done
```

`circleciv2 (beta)`

Same as `circleciv1` but outputs the v2 format.
